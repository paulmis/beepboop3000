CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:19 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findpigpiod_if2.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project
  has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "pigpiod_if2", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "pigpiod_if2" with
  any of the following names:

    pigpiod_if2Config.cmake
    pigpiod_if2-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "pigpiod_if2" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "pigpiod_if2_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "pigpiod_if2" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it
  has been installed.
